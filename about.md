Just another yak shaver

### More Information

**Yak shaving**

> Yak shaving is what you are doing when you're doing some stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what you're supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal relations links what you're doing to the original meta-task.
>
> *"Hey, Scott, can you deploy that web site?*
>
> *Ok, do I have access? No, gotta get it. Passwords? Deployment technique? Web Farm? Scaling how? Web framework not configured? Oh, what about the connection string?*
>
> *"Hey, Scott, is that site deployed yet?"*
>
> *"No, I'm still shaving this yak."*
